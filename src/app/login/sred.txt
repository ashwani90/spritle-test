I am asking for that much amount because I want to be a part of your organisation for longer time. Salary is the main reason that I am leaving my present organisation.
I also have better opportunities at my hand 

Salary is the main reason that I am feeling the need to change my current company.
As far as my skill set is concerned I know I am able to get better job and
I am having some better opportunities waiting.
I have asked for 3 lpa. because I want to stay in a company for longer time 
and I don't want to keep on changing after few months.
Salary wise I will be satified and I won't feel the need to change
This will benefit me in my career and the company also.
